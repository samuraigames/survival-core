 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Survival Core Game
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for player progress and user profiles,
 * while allowing public read access to game-level and achievement definitions.
 * It also manages a public-write, unique-creation collection for usernames.
 * Admins are granted special write access to player progress for management purposes.
