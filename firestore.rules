/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Survival Core Game
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for player progress and user profiles,
 * while allowing public read access to game-level and achievement definitions.
 * It also manages a public-write, unique-creation collection for usernames.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /levels/{levelId}: Stores publicly readable level definitions.
 * - /achievements/{achievementId}: Stores publicly readable achievement definitions.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user-specific profile data, only writable by the owner.
 * - /users/{userId}/playerProgress/main: Stores player-specific progress data, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /usernames/{username}: Maps usernames to UIDs for uniqueness checks. Writable on create only.
