/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Survival Core Game
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for player progress,
 * while allowing public read access to game-level and achievement definitions.
 * Write access to levels and achievements is restricted to backend processes (not covered here).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /levels/{levelId}: Stores publicly readable level definitions.
 * - /achievements/{achievementId}: Stores publicly readable achievement definitions.
 * - /users/{userId}/playerProgress/main: Stores player-specific progress data, accessible only to the owning user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read-Only Collections: The 'levels' and 'achievements' collections are readable by all users.
 * - Strict Ownership: A user can only access their own player progress data under /users/{userId}.
 * - Denormalization: To optimize security rules, any authorization-related data (e.g., ownership)
 *   should be denormalized directly onto the documents.
